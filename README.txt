**1) Track Order Using Pre-Built Templates**
WooCommerce Order Tracker provides a diverse range of three distinct order-tracking templates, which enables you to incorporate captivating visual representations for different order statuses, such as on-hold, processing, delivery, and more. These templates offer an engaging and gamified experience to enhance the tracking process and keep customers informed at every stage of their orders.

Define order statuses that cater to the distinct stages within your shipping process. Additionally, you can personalize each custom order status by assigning a chosen image that resonates with your brand. 

**3) Track Order With Google Maps**
The Track Order with Google Maps feature allows customers to track their orders in real-time using Google Maps API integration. You have to provide the Google Maps API key, the order production house address, and the lessons of the order transit locations. Once enabled, customers can view the progress of their order on a Google Maps map.

**4) Third-party Shipment Tracking (FedEx)**

**5) Replace Order Status Text With Icons**
You can replace the order status text with relevant icons in the order details table, allowing customers to quickly grasp the status of their orders at a glance.
